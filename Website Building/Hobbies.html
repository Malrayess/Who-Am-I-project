    I have a wide range of hobbies. Some of my hobbies include: Playing basketball, drawing, and playing videogames.
    Starting off with basketball, I love it. I started playing basketball in grade 4, it was then that basketball became my favourite sport,
    and I stopped playing soccer. I wasn't the best at basketball in my early years, but I got better the more I played.
    In grade 7 I was able to join the junior basketball team. We managed to win 3rd place or bronze.
    In grade 8, I was able to join the team again, but I encountered an early injury which stopped me from being able to play for a bit.

    I love playing playing video games, it is one of my most favorite things to do in my free time.
    I play a wide range of games both on computer and playstation 4. Some of the games I play include:
    Overwatch, ARK survival Evolved, Call of Duty, Uncharted, Rocket league and much more.
    The reason why I love playing video games is not only because the game is amazing, but it is because I love playing with my friends.
    Playing together is a lot of fun, we experience many things together and we enjoy playing together,
    and we even have many laughs while playing.

    Finally, drawing is mostly my favourite out of all my hobbies. I began drawing when I was very little, I wasn't the best at that time.
    As I grew up and drew more, my quality of drawings improved and became very good drawings.
    If you'd like to see my drawings, visit the Drawing Gallery tab, there you'll find all my latest drawings.
