<div style="padding:20px;width:40%;float:left;">My name is Maher Al-Rayess. I was born in Windsor, Ontario on October 28, 2002. I'm from Syria but I was born in Canada, so I am Canadian.
  I lived 7 years of my life in Windsor.
  We then moved to Edmonton,Alberta when I was in grade 2. I entered into the Edmonton Islamic Academy and stayed there for 7 years.
  I was widely known in the school by all teachers and students.
  The reason being is that I had a very nice voice in reciting the Quran, our holy book.
  I won first place in all Quran competitions for 7 years in a row. As well as, I was chosen to recite in many events at the school.
  One of those events was Al-Rashid Mosque's 75th Anniversary. In grade 8, I chose to go to Killarney Junior highschool for grade 9.
  That was my last year in E.I.A. After Killarney, I came here to Queen Elizabeth Highschool.
  Here for semester 1, I'm taking courses such as Computer Sciences, Arabic 15, Science 10-1, and Language Arts 10-1.
